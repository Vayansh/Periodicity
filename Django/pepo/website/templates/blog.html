                    <p> I got my first period at the age of 13, which was quite late comparing to my friends. I was really excited to get it and I talked about it with my schoolmates so I thought I will be prepared to finally “become a woman”. The first time was actually terrible. My first period was painful and woke me up at night. I knew what was going on but I was not used to bleeding constantly for a long time so I got a bit scared. I woke up my mum and she helped me to calm down and explained how to wear a pad. The next day she told me for a walk and we got ice-cream. I was feeling proud and mature. In Poland menstruation is not a taboo topic. My friends, both male and female talk about it quite openly and help each other when we feel weak during these days. I think it is really important to accept it the way it is and realize it is an absolutely natural step in every women’s life.

                   <p> When I was young my school conducted a workshop on adolescence for girls and boys separately! That’s when I first heard about periods, it was so weird knowing such bodily processes were going on around me. It occurred during the holidays and my sister was completely engrossed in watching movies. When I told her my exciting news she couldn’t believe it and her and my mom told me to check again- it must be something else. But thanks to the workshop I knew what I was experiencing and was given a white soft cotton cloth shaped like a pad to use. The pad was leak proof and always stayed intact.

                   <p> I got my first period at home when I was thirteen. I was extremely excited about it and ran to tell my mum straight away! The excitement wore off relatively fast as I was faced with the reality of nappy like pads and daunting applicators - however like many I came to comfortably deal with this natural process. For me this was through starting to use reusable. Using my sanitary pad and menstrual cup every month has made my life a lot easier, as well as reducing the environmental and financial expense of my period. It’s different for everyone of course, so it’s so great to share experiences and see how every women has the opportunity to find a way that works for them!

                   <p> “When I was young, must have been in the 8th grade, I’d come back home from school and play dress up with Mum’s sarees. It was fun and I was still a kid, don’t judge. This fine day I had put on a saree and was dancing around the room in front of the mirror doing some weird ninja high kick moves as a part of my dance. While I was doing this I noticed the stains and I kinda freaked. I already knew that this happens and it’s normal and stuff, but it’s still a bit of punch when you realize that it has indeed happened. While I called my mother and told her what had happened, we both pretty much didn’t know how to react. But when she came home she got me some super cute and colourful, big girl’s underwear, because up until then I’d been wearing bloomers.  <br>-Bani,24” </p>

                  <p>  “I was in the 6th grade when I got my first period. Since I studied in a convent, we had weekly classes on Hygiene and how to handle menstruation, since we were coming of age, so I pretty much knew everything that was going to happen when my period came and how to take care of it. I remember we had our annual break after the Final Term exams, and I got my first cramps. I’d been sitting in a crouched position holding myself and generally whining because of the pain, this when my paternal grandmother and mother realized that I was probably going to get my period soon. So this happy pair, super excited came to me and started talking about all the changes that my body was going through, having already heard and understood everything at school, in my crampy, grumpy state, I told them that I knew where the conversation was going and that I didn’t want to have it since I pretty much already knew everything there was to know. This really took the wind out of their sails. After a couple of days, I finally got my first period and I realized this while I was in the bathroom. As I stepped out I called my mom and said: “ The time has come, hand me the pads.”  And that is the story of my first period.”

                <p> <strong><u style="font-size: 150%;">Breaking Down Stigma- </u> </strong> A girl’s first period can be exciting because it is a symbol of entering womanhood. But it can also be confusing and a bit intimidating. That’s because a lot of girls are not equipped with all the right information to manage their first menstrual cycle. Society often treats periods and women’s health in general as if it’s something you don’t talk about in public. Menstruation awareness can help erase the stigmas around periods. That doesn’t just apply to girls who will experience menstruation firsthand. Boys need to be in on the conversation too so they know there’s nothing “gross” about a girl being on her period. </p>

                <p><strong><u style="font-size: 125%;">Educating young people- </u></strong> Because of the stigmas, some girls may not want to talk to their parents or guardians about their periods. If they hear the facts from reliable sources, they will not have good information to follow, the mystery surrounding periods will go away. Normalizing open conversations about menstruation will help girls learn about the different feminine hygiene products available to them and how to properly use them. Creating awareness and openness is one of the most effective ways to help teach girls how to properly manage their menstrual hygiene.</p>

                <p>><strong><u style="font-size: 125%; margin-bottom: 0;">Addressing period poverty- </u></strong> Period poverty is a continuing issue in India due to the cultural stigma surrounding menstruation. Many people consider menstruation a taboo topic that they should not discuss. In India, research has indicated that 71% of girls do not have “knowledge of menstruation before their first period.” This lack of knowledge and stigma surrounding menstruation has led to one out of every five female students dropping out of school once menstruation begins. In addition, more than 40% of female students in India choose not to attend school during their menstrual cycle due to the inability to access menstrual products.</p>
