2)Our period tracker idea to connect people to a gynecologist.
3)Integration of multiple period accessibility tools.

What was our motivation to make the project?
ans: Negative taboos condition us to understand menstrual function 
as something to be hidden, something shameful. And by not 
naming a thing, we reinforce the idea that the thing should not be named.
We had a very clear objective in mind. That was to eliminate the thought
process of periods being a cultural/religious taboo subject.
